# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Machine Learning model to predict heart disease with highest efficiency

Predicting and diagnosing heart disease is the biggest challenge in the medical industry and relies on factors such as the physical examination, symptoms and signs of the patient. Factors that influence heart disease are body cholesterol levels, smoking habit and obesity, family history of illnesses, blood pressure, and work environment. Machine learning algorithms play an essential and precise role in the prediction of heart disease.

Heart disease can be predicted based on various symptoms such as age, gender, heart rate, etc. and reduces the death rate of heart patients.

This problem can be treated as a binary classification based problem on whether a person has a heart disease or not. Hence, Classification based Machine Learning Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, etc can be used to solve this problem and the algorithm with the best accuracy can be chosen as the final solution based on different evaluation metrics.
